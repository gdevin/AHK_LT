# AHK_LT
AutoHotKey script for LiveTime

This script eliminates the tedious mouse moving and clicking needed to create rounds in LiveTime.

Installation is done by installing AutoHotKey from www.autohotkey.com and downloading the script and jpeg images from the AHK_LT folder in this repository.  Then run the script and use the following keys when in LiveTime to manage your race.

Ctrl-f Finishes a race.<br />
Ctrl-w If a wreck occurs and you need to false start a race.<br />
Ctrl-y Same as Alt-y, use this to select Yes.<br />
Ctrl-g Generate the next round.<br />

The script uses the AHK ImageSearch function.  This should work on most system, but your mileage may vary.
